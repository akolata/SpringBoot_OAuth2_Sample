# SpringBoot_OAuth2_Sample

Simple application just to see how OAuth2 works with Spring.

Application based on code from those tutorials :
https://gigsterous.github.io/engineering/2017/03/01/spring-boot-4.html
http://websystique.com/spring-security/secure-spring-rest-api-using-oauth2/ ( pure Spring, no Boot here)

# Approach

Resource server and authorization server are the same application here.
